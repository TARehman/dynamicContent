Several EU leaders have criticised Turkey, amid a growing row over the Turkish government's attempts to hold rallies in European countries.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Germany and the Netherlands of "Nazism" after officials blocked rallies there.
Dutch PM Mark Rutte called his comments "unacceptable", while Germany's foreign minister said he hoped Turkey would "return to its senses".
Denmark's leader has also postponed a planned meeting with Mr Erdogan.
Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said he was concerned that "democratic principles are under great pressure" in Turkey.
He added that he had postponed the meeting because: "With the current Turkish attacks on Holland the meeting cannot be seen separated from that."
