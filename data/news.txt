The election commission in Wisconsin has received a request for a recount of the votes in the state narrowly won by Donald Trump more than two weeks ago.
The request was filed by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein.
Dr Stein has also pledged to file vote recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Dr Stein's campaign needs to raise millions of dollars to cover the fees for the vote recount in all three states.
